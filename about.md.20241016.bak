Corinne Chin is the director of news talent for recruitment at The Associated Press, working to build and develop a diverse and inclusive global newsroom. She is also a video journalist whose coverage of <a href="http://st.news/disappearingdaughters" target="_blank">femicide on the U.S.-Mexico border</a> earned a National Emmy Award in 2021. 

In her current role, Corinne oversees hiring and recruitment for the AP’s News division, including its Global News Internship program. She is also part of the team running LEAD, an internal leadership program designed to cultivate and empower AP’s future leaders.

Before joining the AP, Corinne was a senior video journalist at The Seattle Times, where she started its diversity and inclusion task force, and a senior video producer for CNN's team covering <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/americas/hawaii-sign-language-extinction-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html" target="_blank">gender inequality.</a> As a storyteller, she focused on in-depth digital video projects like <a href="https://projects.seattletimes.com/2019/beyond-the-border-asylum/" target="_blank">Beyond the Border,</a> a series of visual stories exploring asylum, deportation and border issues; and <a href="http://st.news/under-our-skin" target="_blank">Under Our Skin,</a> an interactive documentary exploring the words we use – and misuse – to talk about race in America.

In addition to the national News and Documentary Emmys, her work has been recognized internationally by the Online News Association, Pictures of the Year International, National Edward R. Murrow Awards, National Press Photographers Association's Best of Photojournalism and more. She has also served as a judge for several of these competitions, including the OJAs, POYI and the Society for News Design.

She is an alumna of the IWMF’s Next Gen Safety Trainers Fellowship. She is also available for public speaking on video storytelling and diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.

Corinne is a graduate of Poynter’s Leadership Academies for Women and for Diversity, the Maynard 200, ASNE/NLA Emerging Leaders Institute, IWMF Next Gen Safety Trainers fellowship and Northwestern University’s Medill School (MSJ and BSJ).
