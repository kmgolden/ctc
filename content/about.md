Corinne Chin is the director of news talent for recruitment at The Associated Press, working to build and develop a diverse and inclusive global newsroom. She is also a video journalist whose coverage of <a href="http://st.news/disappearingdaughters" target="_blank">femicide on the U.S.-Mexico border</a> earned a National Emmy Award in 2021. 

In her current role, Corinne leads global hiring and recruitment for the AP’s News division, including its Global News Internship program. She is also part of the team running LEAD, an internal leadership program designed to cultivate and empower AP’s future leaders.

Before joining the AP, Corinne was a senior video journalist at <a href="http://st.news/under-our-skin" target="_blank">The Seattle Times</a>, where she started its diversity and inclusion task force, and a senior video producer for CNN's team covering <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/americas/hawaii-sign-language-extinction-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html" target="_blank">gender inequality</a>. As a storyteller, she focused on in-depth digital video projects like <a href="https://projects.seattletimes.com/2019/beyond-the-border-asylum/" target="_blank">Beyond the Border</a>, a series of visual stories exploring asylum, deportation and border issues supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation and the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting; and <a href="http://st.news/under-our-skin" target="_blank">Under Our Skin</a>, an interactive documentary exploring the words we use – and misuse – to talk about race in America.

Her work has been recognized by the national News and Documentary Emmys, National Edward R. Murrow Awards, Online News Association, National Press Photographers Association's Best of Photojournalism, Pictures of the Year International and more. She has also served as a judge for several of these competitions, including the OJAs, POYI, CPOY and the Society for News Design. Her short films have screened at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival and the Seattle Asian American Film Festival. 

Corinne draws from her experience reporting across the globe – from <a href="http://st.news/disappearingdaughters" target="_blank">Mexico</a>, Brazil, Kenya and more – to offer trauma-informed safety and security training. She has also taught visual journalism for Photographic Center Northwest and numerous early career programs, including NPR’s Next Generation Radio. 

Corinne is available for public speaking on video storytelling, careers, journalist safety and diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. She has been a featured speaker at national conferences for the Online News Association, National Press Photographers Association, National Association of Hispanic Journalists and Asian American Journalists Association. 

Corinne is a proud graduate of Poynter’s Leadership Academies for Women and for Diversity, the Maynard 200 fellowship, ASNE/NLA Emerging Leaders Institute, IWMF Next Gen Safety Trainers fellowship and Northwestern University’s Medill School (MSJ and BSJ).
